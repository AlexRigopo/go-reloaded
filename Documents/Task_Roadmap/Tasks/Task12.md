## **Task 12 – Integration & Reflection: End-to-End, Performance, and Future Enhancements**

### **Goal / Functionality**

- Full end-to-end run (read `.txt` → transform → write) with performance tests, documentation, and a roadmap for improvements (dictionary for article correction, pronunciation DB, better Unicode handling).

### **TDD Steps**

1. **Write failing tests:** CLI-level tests (if feasible) that simulate file input and expect particular output files; benchmark tests for large files.

2. **Implement minimal code:** `cmd/goreloaded/main.go` reading `os.Args[1]`, transforming content, writing output.

3. **Refactor:** Add graceful error handling, logging, and README usage examples; create performance benchmarks and profiling instructions.

### **Validation**

- Manual end-to-end verification with given Golden Test text files.

- Benchmarks for large files (e.g., 10 MB) to measure throughput; pprof for hotspots.

### **Learning Summary**

- Learn CLI building, file I/O, profiling, and documenting the final product for users and maintainers.

### **Why TDD**

- Ensures the command-line contract is explicit and testable; prevents regressions introduced by refactors.

### **Alternatives**

- Provide library-only API vs CLI + library; recommend both: library for reuse and CLI for users.

### **AI assistance**

- AI can generate user-facing docs and sample CLI flags and even produce release notes.

### **Quick Learning Note**

- Use `testing.B` for benchmarks and `net/http/pprof` or `runtime/pprof` to profile CPU/memory. Run `go test -bench . -benchmem`.

### **Challenge**

- What would you measure first if a user reports the tool is slow on a 20 MB file?
