once upon A time , 1a (hex) warriors marched for   11101  (bin)    days. they shouted " this IS (low,2) SPARTA (up) !" but no one retreated...
the old scroll said ' a ancient prophecy (cap,3) shall awaken ' and many didnt believe it !
however , the HIGH PRIEST proclaimed (up,4) " a hero (cap) rises " and THAT was enough.
suddenly , a elephant appeared next to an unicorn and started chanting : " i m THE chosen one (low,3) " .
the crowd didnt know what to say ; some whispered " maybe THIS (low,4) is   FATE  " while others screamed " NOO (low,2)! ".
meanwhile , three  ff (hex) knights guarded a castle with  10101010 (bin) torches, glowing brightly!!!
a hour later , a owl flew into A ancient oak tree (cap,5) without warning.
the wise elder repeated ' i AM invincible (up,2) and immortal ' (cap,4) ,yet fell to a arrow.
" a hero (cap) shall return " , they said, " but THE prophecy (low,3) remains hidden ".
some travelers told stories of " a incredible LEGEND rises (low,3) " but few listened.
one wanderer claimed that  C0FFEE  (hex) beans granted power, while another shouted that  110101 (bin) sheep danced under the moon!!
in the end, everyone agreed on one thing : " a ending (cap) arrives " eventually...
